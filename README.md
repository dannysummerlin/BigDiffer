This Lightning Flow Action allows you to compare two of the same type of Record. One Action (Difference Record) returns a mock Record of the same type with only the differing fields filled in with the values from the comparison record. The other Action (Difference Details) returns a collection of results you can loop through that include the field name, field type, and values of each Record. You can also exclude fields from the comparison by entering a comma-separated list of field API names to make sure secure or inaccessible data are not evaluated.
